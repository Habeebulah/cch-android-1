	<h3>Birds Don't Have Time To Worry</h3>
	"Look at the birds in the sky. They do not plant seeds. They do not gather grain. They do not put grain into a building to keep. Yet your Father in heaven feeds them! Are you not more important than the birds?" - Matthew 6:26 NLV
	<br /><br />
	As I walked outside of our house one day, the light was just beginning to show on the horizon. The birds around our yard were chirping and singing. They were pumped about another day, getting ready to go to work, finding twigs for their nest and worms to chew on. As I continued to watch, I realized those birds didn't have a worry in the world! They show absolute trust for their Creator, while they go about gathering the resources that He makes available to them. But, while the birds trust God day by day, they also work hard from dawn to dusk. As St. Augustine once said, "Pray as if everything depends on God, and then work as if everything depends on you." Pray to the Lord, share your worries and concerns. And then work hard like the birds. They just don't have time to worry. Neither do we, when we trust God and work hard.
